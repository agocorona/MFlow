<h1>Caching AJAX responses to navigate a dataset in the browser using composable caching directives</h1><br>What is the killer appication of the JavasCript frameworks? &nbsp;To present data sets without repeated acesses to the server using the new HTML5 cache.<br><br>Now the new composable cache policies of MFlow permits the use of aggresive caching policies even for highly dynamic pages, since expressing cache directives is in the hands of the programmer of each particular widget, instead of HTTP gurus. The "separation of concern" preclude the synergies between components.<br><br>This example show how the small javascript programs generated by witerate and dField are cached to navigate the infinite dataset of the natural numbers in both directions without roundtrips to the server.<br><br>To understand how it works see:<br><br><a href="/noscript/wiki/cachingdfield" title="" target="" style="font-family: 'rebuchet MS', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Composable caching</a><span style="font-family: 'rebuchet MS', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">: Now the programmer can express independently the caching policies for each widget</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
