<h1>Initial configuration in persistent session data</h1>This example show how to use a mix of persistent and non persistent flow to create an initial configuration with preferences for the user that will last fo as long as you wish using the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/MFlow/docs/MFlow-Forms.html#v:setTimeouts" title="" target="">setTimeouts </a>primitive. &nbsp;<br><br>In this case the user chooses an skin. That option is saved and will persist even if the server shutdown. &nbsp;The user is not asked again when he enter into the option. But he can change it at any time using the link to do so. This data is stored in the session. <br><br>Note the use of step to store persistently the configuration and to preclude being asked again. &nbsp;
